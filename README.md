# Mars Rover

- Design
  - see [./Design](./Design)

- Assumptions
  - Grid points are positive whole numbers.
  - Rovers can only travel along grid points (i.e. instructions for rovers will only be in whole numbers).
  - The maximum grid point value will be no more than the maximum value of the uint C# class.
  - The number of possible rovers is unlimited.
